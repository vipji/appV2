# Configuration Guide for Switching to dev1x.lovestoblog.com

## LOCATION #1: package.json
File: /package.json

CHANGE THIS:
  "homepage": "https://vipji.github.io/dev1x/"

TO THIS:
  "homepage": "https://dev1x.lovestoblog.com/"

WHY: This tells npm/build tools where your app will be deployed.
Used for generating correct asset paths during build.

---

## LOCATION #2: vite.config.ts
File: /vite.config.ts

CHANGE THIS:
  base: "/dev1x",

TO THIS (for root domain):
  base: "/",

WHY: The base path tells Vite where the app is served from.
- "/dev1x" = GitHub Pages subdirectory
- "/" = root of custom domain

AFTER CHANGING: Run `npm run build`

---

## LOCATION #3: .github/workflows/deploy.yml (Deployment Notification)
File: /.github/workflows/deploy.yml

CHANGE THIS:
  deployment_url: 'https://vipji.github.io/dev1x/',

TO THIS:
  deployment_url: 'https://dev1x.lovestoblog.com/',

WHY: This URL is sent in deployment success notifications.

---

## LOCATION #4: .github/workflows/deploy.yml (Release Notes)
File: /.github/workflows/deploy.yml

CHANGE THIS:
  **Deployed to:** https://vipji.github.io/dev1x/

TO THIS:
  **Deployed to:** https://dev1x.lovestoblog.com/

WHY: This URL appears in GitHub Release notes.

---

## DYNAMIC URLS (No Changes Needed)

Share URL generation (src/components/EnhancedCodeEditor.tsx) automatically uses:
- window.location.origin
- window.location.pathname

So it will automatically work on any domain where the app is hosted.

---
